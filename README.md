## 👋 Hi, I'm Robert!

📚 As a current student at Codeup's coding bootcamp, I'm actively learning and working with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Java SE, Java EE (Servlets, JSP, J2EE), Spring Boot, MySQL, and Thymeleaf. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and further develop my skills in these areas, as well as explore new technologies and frameworks.


🤝 I believe in the power of collaboration and would love to connect with like-minded professionals. If you'd like to work together or simply chat, feel free to reach out to me at robert.j.mendez3@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-mendez-3573bb254/)
